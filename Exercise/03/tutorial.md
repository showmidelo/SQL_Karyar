Check https://blog.devart.com/how-to-optimize-sql-query.html 
and answer why we should obey things said below.

    1. Add missing indexes

    2.  Check for unused indexes

    3.  Avoid using multiple OR in the FILTER predicate

    4.  Use wildcards at the end of a phrase only

    5.  Avoid too many JOINs

    6. Avoid using SELECT DISTINCT

    7. Use SELECT fields instead of SELECT *

    8. Use Limit to sample query results

    9. Create JOINs with INNER JOIN (not WHERE)

Index in databases:

     1. Using indexes optimizes query performance.
        a) True
        b) False

    2. What is the purpose of the index in sql server?
        a) To enhance the query performance
        b) To provide an index to a record
        c) To perform fast searches
        d) All of the mentioned

    3. Does index take space in the disk?
        a) It stores memory as and when required
        b) Yes, Indexes are stored on disk
        c) Indexes are never stored on disk
        d) Indexes take no space

    4. Since an index improves performance, why don't we index all the columns by default? 

    5. How can we see all indexes set on a table? and how we can remove any one of them? (try to write some query)
